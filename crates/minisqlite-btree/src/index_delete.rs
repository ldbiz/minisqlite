//! `index_delete`: remove a key from an index b-tree, keeping the tree a valid,
//! balanced CLASSIC B-tree (the shape real sqlite writes and reads back).
//!
//! This is the index analogue of `delete` (the table b-tree DELETE), but the
//! structural rules differ because an index is a CLASSIC B-tree, not the B+-style
//! rowid table: an interior divider IS a real index entry, present exactly ONCE in
//! the whole tree, sitting in in-order position strictly between its two child
//! subtrees. So a divider can never be silently dropped the way a table b-tree's
//! rowid separator can — every divider is a live key that must be preserved.
//!
//! ## Shape of the algorithm
//! 1. **Locate** the key. It is either a LEAF cell or an interior DIVIDER (the
//!    descent stops at an interior page whose divider equals the key).
//! 2. A LEAF key is removed directly; an interior DIVIDER is removed by the classic
//!    predecessor swap (below).
//! 3. **Remove the cell** from its leaf — an O(cell) in-place splice
//!    (`Pager::page_mut` and `fileformat::delete_cell`) that leaves a freeblock (NOT
//!    defragmented) on the transactional fast route, else a whole-page rebuild that
//!    streams survivors into a fresh defragmented page on the auto-commit fallback
//!    (see `drop_leaf_cell_in_place`). The root leaf is always left as-is; a non-root
//!    leaf that UNDERFLOWS — it empties, or the drop leaves it under ~1/3 full by TOTAL
//!    free space (freeblocks included, so the two routes agree) — is rebalanced, so a
//!    delete-heavy workload keeps the page density real sqlite maintains
//!    (see `leaf_underflows`).
//!
//! ## Deleting an interior divider (predecessor swap, with split on overflow)
//! To delete divider `K` at `(pid, ptr)`: find its in-order predecessor `P` — the
//! maximum key of `K`'s left subtree = the last cell of that subtree's right-most leaf
//! `pred_leaf`. **Install `P` over `K`'s slot** (a real replace-in-place, so `P`'s
//! overflow chain becomes the divider's and `K`'s old chain is freed), then **remove
//! `P` from `pred_leaf`**. `P < K`, so after the swap `P` is still `>` every remaining
//! key of the left subtree and `<` every key of the right subtree — the divider
//! invariant holds.
//!
//! `P` can encode WIDER than `K` (key size and key order are independent — a long TEXT
//! predecessor, a large-magnitude integer), so installing it can OVERFLOW `pid`. That
//! is not an error: `pid` is split and the promoted divider propagated up exactly as
//! an insert split does (`index::propagate_split` / `balance_deeper_interior`, the one
//! shared implementation). Because the leaf side (`pred_leaf`) is handled *after* the
//! interior is made consistent, and its leaf-cell drop needs no path, a split cannot
//! corrupt it. When `pred_leaf` also underflows, its rebalance needs a root→leaf path;
//! if the swap split `pid` that recorded path is stale, so we re-descend for a fresh one
//! (rare²: only a wide-predecessor swap that overflows AND underflows its leaf).
//!
//! ## Rebalancing is a classic-B underflow fix (rotate / merge / redistribute)
//! `index_insert` keeps every non-root interior at K>=2 (>=3 children) and every
//! non-root leaf at >=1 cell (fileformat2 §1.6 — the only K<2 interior it allows is
//! page 1, which an index root never is). So the textbook invariant holds BEFORE each
//! delete, and this module RE-ESTABLISHES it after. When a non-root leaf underflows (or,
//! climbing, a non-root interior falls to K<2) we GATHER the underflowing node with an
//! adjacent sibling and the real divider between them, then REDISTRIBUTE the gathered
//! sequence into the fewest valid pages: one page is a MERGE (the parent loses a child
//! + its bordering divider); two-or-more is a REDISTRIBUTE that promotes fresh boundary
//! divider(s) back to the parent. A merge can push the parent below K>=2 in turn, so we
//! climb one level and repeat (bounded by tree height, no re-descent). Variable-width
//! keys make a naive two-node merge unsafe — it can overflow, or leave two halves that
//! cannot both reach K>=2 — so when two nodes cannot repack into all-valid pages we fold
//! in a further adjacent sibling and repack across the wider window (real sqlite's
//! balance uses up to three; the gather widens as far as it must). A REDISTRIBUTE (or a
//! net-growing MERGE) promotes fresh boundary dividers into the parent, and a promoted
//! index key can encode WIDER than the one it replaced — so rewriting a near-full parent
//! can OVERFLOW one page. That is NOT an error: the parent then SPLITS and propagates up
//! exactly as an insert split does (`split_interior_and_propagate`, the same growth the
//! predecessor swap above uses), so the DELETE succeeds like real sqlite instead of
//! failing closed. The `split_index_interior` it calls fails closed only on the
//! pre-existing large-page m<5 edge (see its docs), unreachable at the <=8 KiB pages an
//! index interior overflows at (m>=5 there). The `index_balance` planners choose the group
//! boundaries; see `rebalance_after_leaf_underflow`.
//!
//! ## Space reclamation
//! The deleted key's overflow chain (freed in phases 1-3) and every page a merge or a
//! root collapse makes redundant are returned to the freelist, so a delete-heavy
//! workload stays bounded (as real sqlite does). No DIVIDER chain is freed during a
//! rebalance: gather/redistribute preserves every surviving key exactly once (a divider
//! is a live key), so its chain is always still referenced. Redundant pages are freed
//! AFTER all writes complete (no live page-view borrow), so a following insert reuses
//! them and a delete never grows the file.
