//! `IndexCursor` — a borrowing forward/reverse/seek reader over an index b-tree,
//! the index analogue of `TableCursor`.
//!
//! This index b-tree is a CLASSIC B-tree (like real sqlite's): every key appears
//! exactly ONCE, and an interior cell's divider is itself a real index entry that
//! sits in-order BETWEEN its two child subtrees. So a full in-order scan must
//! interleave interior dividers with leaf keys — a leaf-only scan (as a B+-tree
//! cursor does) would silently drop every entry that lives in an interior page.
//!
//! The cursor holds a descent **stack** of `(page_id, idx)` from the root to the
//! current position. The TOP frame is the current entry and its page may be a LEAF
//! (`idx` = the current cell) or an INTERIOR page (`idx` = the current divider cell
//! we are positioned AT, having just yielded it). Every NON-top frame is an interior
//! ancestor whose `idx` is the child-pointer index descended to reach the frame
//! below. These two readings of an interior `idx` coincide by construction: after
//! exhausting the subtree under pointer `i` (going forward) the next entry is divider
//! `i`, and to advance off divider `i` we descend pointer `i+1` — so `idx` is simply
//! bumped from `i` to `i+1` at that transition (and the mirror for `prev`).
//!
//! That stack makes `next`/`prev` cost O(tree height) amortized: a step advances or
//! retreats within a leaf, climbs to the nearest ancestor divider not yet yielded, or
//! descends one child's left (`next`) / right (`prev`) spine — never re-seeking from
//! the root — so a full scan is linear.
//!
//! `key` returns the FULL index record for the current position — the indexed columns
//! followed by the trailing rowid — reading a LEAF cell or an INTERIOR divider cell
//! depending on the top frame's page, as `Cow::Borrowed` of the cell's bytes with no
//! copy when the key has no overflow (an overflowed key is reassembled into an owned
//! buffer). The executor consumes an index entry by reading `key`, decoding its LAST
//! column to recover the rowid, and then seeking the table b-tree by that rowid, so
//! `key` must return the whole record including the rowid — it does not strip it.
