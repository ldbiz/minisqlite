//! Transaction control at the engine level: `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`,
//! `SAVEPOINT` / `RELEASE` / `ROLLBACK TO`, and the shared
//! [`SqlEngine::with_write_txn`] wrapper that runs a catalog mutation (DDL) inside
//! the right transaction. These drive the [`Pager`] seam and the connection's
//! transaction state.
//!
//! A transaction can be started two ways: an explicit `BEGIN` (sets
//! [`SqlEngine::in_explicit_txn`]) or a `SAVEPOINT` issued in autocommit (starts a
//! transaction in the pager and pushes onto [`SqlEngine::savepoints`], leaving
//! `in_explicit_txn` false). So the one predicate for "a transaction is active" is
//! [`SqlEngine::txn_active`], NOT `in_explicit_txn` alone — every autocommit vs.
//! join-the-open-transaction decision routes through it.
