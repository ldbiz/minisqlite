//! Shared index maintenance for the DML write operators (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and
//! `DELETE`).
//!
//! The index KEY encoding and the UNIQUE-conflict probe must be IDENTICAL across all
//! three operators: an index entry and the table row it points at must never disagree,
//! or a later read seeks a key that was written under different rules. Keeping the one
//! copy here — rather than a per-operator copy that can drift — makes that a structural
//! guarantee instead of a convention three files have to remember.
//!
//! TWO-PHASE maintenance (EVAL then WRITE). An index key column can be an ORDINARY
//! column (`IndexKeyPart::Col`) or a compiled EXPRESSION (`IndexKeyPart::Expr`, e.g.
//! `CREATE INDEX i ON t(a+b)`). Evaluating an expression key needs an [`EvalCtx`] whose
//! `env` holds a SHARED `&dyn Pager`; writing an index entry needs `&mut dyn Pager`. The
//! two borrows cannot co-exist, so key computation is split from the b-tree write exactly
//! as the DML ops already evaluate CHECK constraints before their mutating write:
//! [`index_key_values`] / [`index_keys_for_plans`] EVAL the keys (shared pager, a ctx),
//! then [`insert_index_entries`] / [`delete_index_entries`] WRITE the precomputed keys
//! (mut pager, no ctx). For an all-ordinary-column index (every key part `Col`) the eval
//! phase never touches the ctx and produces the same `[cols.., rowid]` key a single-phase
//! path would; an index with an expression key column evaluates that column through the ctx.
//! Both shapes share this one path, so the ordinary case is behavior-neutral and the two
//! can never encode a key differently.
//!
//! PARTIAL indexes (`CREATE INDEX … WHERE <pred>`, `partialindex.html` §2) gate on the SAME
//! eval phase: [`IndexPlan::partial_predicate`] carries the compiled WHERE predicate, and the
//! EVAL functions return `None` for a row the predicate does not admit ([`index_admits_row`]),
//! so that row gets no entry, no UNIQUE probe, and no delete in ANY operator. The keys a
//! frame produces are therefore `Option`-typed and stay 1:1 with the plans; the WRITE phase
//! and the operators' probe loops simply skip a `None`. A full index has `partial_predicate ==
//! None` and every key is `Some`, so its behavior is unchanged.
//!
//! Effect surface: [`index_key_values`] / [`index_keys_for_plans`] and [`build_index_plan`]
//! read only values/defs (and, for an expression key, the shared pager via the ctx);
//! [`build_index_plans`] READS the schema (catalog) then delegates per index to
//! [`build_index_plan`]; [`unique_conflict_rowid`] (with its boolean façade
//! [`unique_conflict`]) READS the index b-tree (a pager cursor); only
//! [`insert_index_entries`] / [`delete_index_entries`] WRITE. Every SECONDARY-INDEX mutation
//! flows through those two, so the delete path cannot encode a key differently from the
//! insert path. (The WITHOUT ROWID primary-key b-tree is the table's own storage, not a
//! secondary index, and is written directly by the INSERT operator — not through here.)
