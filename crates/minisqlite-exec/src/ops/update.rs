//! The `UPDATE` DML operator: eager two-phase rewrite, then stream `RETURNING`.
//!
//! Structurally identical to [`insert`](super::insert): an `UPDATE` must apply its
//! whole scan before it can report anything, so it does all its work on the FIRST
//! `next_row` pull — where the [`Runtime`] is in hand for the change counter — and
//! then streams any buffered `RETURNING` rows one per later pull.
//!
//! Two phases that cannot overlap. The scan borrows the pager `&dyn Pager` (a read
//! cursor) while the write path needs the exclusive `&mut dyn Pager`; so phase one
//! drains the ENTIRE scan under a shared reborrow and buffers it, and only once that
//! borrow is released does phase two take `&mut` and rewrite. Buffering is also
//! load-bearing for correctness, not just borrows: it is SQLite's pre-update
//! snapshot (every row's assignments see the table as it was before any write), AND
//! it is what lets the scan be an `IndexScan` on an index this statement rewrites —
//! we never mutate a b-tree while a cursor is walking it. The buffer is bounded by
//! the updated set; nothing larger is materialized.
//!
//! One `OR REPLACE`-only wrinkle to the snapshot: an earlier row's victim deletion (or
//! its rowid move onto a slot a later buffered row still points at) can leave a LATER
//! buffered row stale — the physical row at its `old_rowid` was deleted or replaced. So
//! the write phase re-reads such a row LIVE before rewriting it — exactly SQLite's second
//! UPDATE pass, which re-reads each row and skips one already deleted to make room. This
//! is gated on `OR REPLACE` and on the row's slot actually having been touched (tracked
//! in an `invalidated` set), so a non-REPLACE UPDATE and every untouched row pay nothing;
//! Abort/Ignore can never create the interference (a colliding move errors or skips).
//! CAVEAT: this closes only the staleness the REPLACE CONFLICT mechanism creates. It does
//! NOT cover a DIFFERENT pre-existing source — an FK ON UPDATE referential action (or a
//! nested trigger) that rewrites ANOTHER row in this same buffer mid-statement; that row's
//! later iteration still runs from its pre-image, a cross-cutting UPDATE/DELETE staleness
//! best fixed once for the whole operator, not just for REPLACE.
//!
//! Row shapes. The scan's LEADING columns are the target row `[c0..c_{N-1}, rowid]`
//! (width `N+1`, per the shared ROW/REGISTER convention); a plain `UPDATE` scan is
//! exactly that, while an `UPDATE ... FROM` join row is WIDER — the FROM tables'
//! columns trail after the target's rowid and are read only by the assignment/`WHERE`
//! exprs, never by the target write (which reads only the leading `[0..N]` + rowid).
//! Each assignment value expr is evaluated against that whole OLD row; `RETURNING` is
//! evaluated against the UPDATED target row (the `[cols.., rowid]` shape, width `N+1`,
//! rebuilt from the new values — never the wide join row). Affinity is applied to
//! ASSIGNED values only — an unassigned column keeps its already-stored
//! (already-affinity-applied) value.
