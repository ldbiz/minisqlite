//! Index access path: [`index_scan`] positions on an index b-tree and iterates the
//! matching entries in key order. For each entry it recovers the rowid from the index
//! key and, UNLESS the scan is covering, fetches the base-table row by that rowid; a
//! COVERING scan ([`IndexScan::covering`]) instead builds the row straight from the index
//! entry, skipping the fetch (optoverview.html §"Covering Indexes"). Like every table leaf
//! it emits `[c0, …, c_{N-1}, rowid]` (width `N+1`) and prepends the `outer` row when
//! non-empty — the covering and fetch paths produce the byte-identical shape.
//!
//! ## WITHOUT ROWID secondary index (fetch-by-PK)
//! A secondary index on a WITHOUT ROWID table keys each entry by
//! `[indexed cols.., trailing PK..]` (fileformat2 §2.5.1) — there is NO trailing rowid. So
//! the WR read recovers the full PRIMARY KEY from the entry (via the shared
//! [`super::dml_index`] `WrIndexKey` layout, so read and write agree) and fetches the row
//! from the WR PRIMARY KEY b-tree (`table.root_page`, itself an index b-tree) by that PK,
//! emitting the width-`N` row a WR `SeqScan` emits (no trailing rowid register). The
//! equality-prefix and range-bound classification is UNCHANGED — the indexed columns still
//! lead every entry, and the trailing PK sits past the indexed-column count the bounds apply
//! to. Covering is disabled for WR (its emit shape is width-`N`, not the rowid `N+1`).
//!
//! A [`IndexOp::Seek`] is a real b-tree SEEK, not a full index scan: the cursor is
//! positioned with `seek_ge` / `seek_le` and the walk STOPS the moment the equality
//! prefix no longer matches (the index is ordered, so no later entry can match). Only
//! the entries the op actually selects are visited — cost is proportional to the
//! matches, not the index size.
//!
//! ## Ordering / collation invariant (load-bearing)
//! The index b-tree orders keys under `Collation::Binary` (see
//! `minisqlite_btree::index_key::compare_index_keys`). Every prefix/bound comparison
//! here therefore also uses `Collation::Binary`: the "stop once the prefix stops
//! matching" and "stop once the bound is crossed" decisions are only sound if this
//! comparator agrees with the order the cursor seeks in. Per-column collating
//! sequences declared on an index are a cross-crate follow-up (the `IndexDef` carries
//! no per-column collation today).
//!
//! ## Reverse positioning (the group-top problem)
//! Forward is straightforward: `seek_ge` on the low side lands at the first matching
//! entry and `next()` walks up. Reverse is subtler because
//! `IndexCursor::seek_le(prefix)` lands strictly BELOW the prefix group (a shorter
//! record sorts `Less` than any full key sharing it), and there is no universal
//! maximum `Value` to seek to a group's TOP. So for the two cases where the reverse
//! start is the top of a value group — an *inclusive* upper bound whose value is
//! actually present, and an equality prefix with *no* upper bound — the start is found
//! by walking forward across that one boundary group (bounded by matching rows; it
//! never scans non-matching prefixes). See [`IndexScanCursor::position_reverse_start`].
