//! FOREIGN KEY enforcement — the CHILD side (`foreignkeys.html` §3, `PRAGMA
//! foreign_keys`).
//!
//! On INSERT or UPDATE of a row in a table that declares outgoing foreign keys, verify
//! each referenced PARENT key exists — the immediate check `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` turns
//! on. This is a no-op when the pragma is OFF (SQLite's default) or the table has no FK,
//! so a non-FK workload pays nothing.
//!
//! SCOPE (honest, deliberate):
//! * The CHILD side only: a new/updated child row must point at an existing parent row, or
//!   carry a NULL in any key column (MATCH SIMPLE — SQLite's only supported match mode:
//!   "if any of the child key columns are NULL, then there is no requirement for a
//!   corresponding row in the parent table").
//! * The PARENT side, ON DELETE — `NO ACTION` / `RESTRICT` reject (a surviving child
//!   reference raises `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`); `CASCADE` deletes the matching
//!   child rows (maintaining their indexes and recursing so a cascaded child that is
//!   itself a parent cascades on to its own children); `SET NULL` rewrites each matching
//!   child, setting its FK columns to NULL (re-encoding the record and moving its index
//!   entries). `SET DEFAULT` sets the child FK columns to their column defaults and then
//!   re-checks the FK (a default that references no surviving parent row raises the
//!   violation — `foreignkeys.html` §4.3). `SET NULL` / `SET DEFAULT` are skipped (the
//!   child is left as-is) for a child that has generated columns (its STORED generated
//!   values would need recomputing from the rewritten row — machinery not wired here yet).
//!   A CASCADE/SET-NULL child rewrite does NOT yet fire the child's triggers, and (per
//!   `sqlite3_changes()`, which excludes FK-action rows) does not advance `changes()`.
//! * The PARENT side, ON UPDATE — when an UPDATE changes a REFERENCED parent key,
//!   `NO ACTION` / `RESTRICT` reject a surviving child reference; `CASCADE` copies the new
//!   key into the matching children's FK columns (recursing); `SET NULL` nulls them and
//!   `SET DEFAULT` resets them to their column defaults (then re-checks the FK), both skipped
//!   for a generated-column child. An UPDATE that leaves every referenced key unchanged fires
//!   no action (`foreignkeys.html` §4.3). Same trigger / `changes()` narrowing as ON DELETE.
//! * DEFERRED timing (`foreignkeys.html` §4.2). A `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`
//!   constraint — or ANY constraint while `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys` is ON — is checked at
//!   COMMIT, not at statement time, but ONLY while an explicit (or savepoint-started)
//!   transaction is open to defer into. The predicate is [`fk_deferred_now`]: when it holds,
//!   the child INSERT/UPDATE check, the parent-side NO ACTION rejection, and the parent-side
//!   SET DEFAULT re-check are all SKIPPED (the database is allowed to sit in violation
//!   mid-transaction), and [`check_deferred_foreign_keys`] re-verifies every deferred FK at
//!   COMMIT — one child-side full scan (ROWID and WITHOUT ROWID children alike) that catches a
//!   child orphan and a parent-side NO-ACTION / SET DEFAULT orphan alike. In AUTOCOMMIT no
//!   transaction is open, so `fk_deferred_now` is false and deferred behaves exactly like
//!   immediate (§4.2). RESTRICT is the exception: it is ALWAYS immediate, even on a deferred FK
//!   (§4.3), so it never routes through the deferral predicate. CASCADE and SET NULL fire
//!   immediately and cannot leave a child-side violation (CASCADE copies a live key; SET NULL
//!   is MATCH-SIMPLE exempt), so their timing is moot; SET DEFAULT fires its action
//!   immediately too, but its post-action FK re-check CAN fail (the default may reference no
//!   surviving parent), so — like NO ACTION — that rejection defers.
//! * The check runs BEFORE the row is written (like NOT NULL/CHECK here), so a row that
//!   references ITSELF by the same key (`INSERT INTO t(id,self) VALUES(1,1)` on a
//!   self-referential FK) is rejected where real sqlite accepts it (it writes then checks).
//!   The common self-ref shape — a NULL root plus children pointing at already-inserted
//!   parents — is unaffected (NULL satisfies, prior rows are present).
//! * WITHOUT ROWID narrowings. A WR table's rows live in a PK-index b-tree, not a rowid
//!   table, so a rowid-table scan cannot decode it. Two paths therefore fail CLOSED (a loud
//!   "not supported" error, never a silent pass or skip): (a) an FK whose PARENT is WITHOUT
//!   ROWID — the child-side existence check [`parent_key_exists`] cannot scan the parent; and
//!   (b) the IMMEDIATE parent-side ON DELETE/UPDATE action on a WITHOUT ROWID CHILD —
//!   [`enforce_parent_delete`] / [`enforce_parent_update`] cannot scan the child to
//!   reject/cascade/null it, so they OVER-reject: they error whenever a WR child merely
//!   DECLARES the FK, even for a parent key no child row references (which real sqlite allows)
//!   — a wider, but still loud (never silent), divergence than (a). A DEFERRED NO ACTION check
//!   is the exception: it defers to the COMMIT recheck. The COMMIT-time deferred recheck
//!   ([`check_table_deferred_fks`]) DOES walk a WR child's PK-index b-tree, so a DEFERRED FK on
//!   a WR child is fully enforced. Correct IMMEDIATE enforcement (seeking the WR parent's
//!   b-tree; scanning + writing back a WR child for CASCADE/SET NULL/SET DEFAULT — or a
//!   read-only PK-index scan to reject only a real dependent for NO ACTION/RESTRICT) is a
//!   follow-up.
