//! The `DELETE` DML operator: eager two-phase removal, then stream `RETURNING`.
//!
//! Like [`insert`](crate::ops::insert), a `DELETE` mutates storage, so it does all
//! its work on the FIRST `next_row` pull — where the [`Runtime`] is in hand for the
//! change counter — and then streams any buffered `RETURNING` rows one per later pull.
//!
//! Two-phase, and why the phases cannot overlap: the scan reads pages through a
//! shared `&dyn Pager` (many read cursors may borrow at once), while the removal
//! needs the exclusive `&mut dyn Pager`. So phase one drains the ENTIRE scan under a
//! shared reborrow into a buffer, and only once that borrow is released does phase
//! two take `&mut` and delete. Buffering the whole scan first is also what makes a
//! `DELETE` whose `scan` is an `IndexScan` over the very index being modified safe:
//! the scan cursor is fully consumed before any entry is removed, so it never reads a
//! tree it is mutating. The buffer is bounded by the rows the scan selects (the rows
//! to delete); nothing larger is materialized.
//!
//! Removal order per row (rowid tables): index entries FIRST, then the table row, so no
//! intermediate state ever leaves an index entry pointing at a missing table row. Both
//! `index_delete` and `table_delete` are idempotent on a missing key/rowid, so a row
//! already gone is a silent no-op rather than an error (it cannot happen from a single
//! scan, but the primitives stay defensive); only a row that was actually present
//! advances the change counter. A WITHOUT ROWID table has no separate table b-tree — a row
//! IS its PRIMARY KEY entry — so its removal deletes every secondary-index entry (keyed by
//! `[indexed cols.., trailing PK..]`, fileformat2 §2.5.1) and then the PRIMARY KEY entry
//! (see [`DeleteCursor::apply_without_rowid`]).
//!
//! Row shape consumed here depends on the target. A ROWID table's `scan` subtree emits
//! `[c0..c_{N-1}, rowid]` (width `N+1`), the rowid in register `N`, and `RETURNING`
//! evaluates against that same row. A WITHOUT ROWID table has no integer rowid: its scan
//! emits the width-`N` row `[c0..c_{N-1}]`, and each row is located in — and removed from —
//! the PRIMARY KEY index b-tree by its PRIMARY KEY (see [`DeleteCursor::apply_without_rowid`]).
