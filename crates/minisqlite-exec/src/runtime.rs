//! [`Runtime`] — the per-connection state expression evaluation reaches for, threaded
//! through every [`RowCursor::next_row`](crate::RowCursor::next_row) pull.
//!
//! It holds four things a statement cannot compute from its rows alone:
//! * a deterministic PRNG for `random()` / `randomblob()` (seeded, SplitMix64, so a
//!   run is reproducible),
//! * the `last_insert_rowid` from the most recent successful `INSERT`,
//! * the per-statement `changes` and the connection-lifetime `total_changes`,
//! * the bound parameters (`?N` / named), read by `EvalExpr::Param`.
//!
//! DML operators mutate the counters (`record_insert` / `record_change`) and the
//! engine reads them back after draining the cursor; the RNG is mutated in place by
//! the function-context callbacks. Everything else (reads) leaves it untouched.
//!
//! It also carries three pieces of *per-execution* scratch, cleared/managed within a
//! statement rather than living for the connection's lifetime: the recursive-CTE
//! working-table stack, the uncorrelated-subquery result cache (see [`CachedSubquery`]
//! and [`clear_subquery_cache`](Runtime::clear_subquery_cache)), and the memo of
//! trigger sets re-compiled for runtime recursion. Finally it holds the trigger-firing
//! depth (bounding recursion) and the connection-level `recursive_triggers` flag (the
//! `PRAGMA` gate that decides whether a trigger-action DML fires further triggers).
