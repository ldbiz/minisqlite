//! `CREATE INDEX` backfill: populate a freshly created (empty) index b-tree from the
//! table rows that already exist.
//!
//! The catalog's `create_index` only allocates an empty index root and writes the
//! `sqlite_schema` row; it does NOT copy existing rows into the index (an index is a
//! redundant copy of ALL the table's rows — `spec/sqlite-doc/lang_createindex.html`).
//! This module is the executor half the engine calls right after `create_index`, in
//! the SAME write transaction, so the schema registration and the backfill commit (or
//! roll back) as one atomic unit.
//!
//! It reuses the SHARED DML index-maintenance path ([`build_index_plan`] +
//! [`insert_index_entries`] + [`unique_conflict`]) rather than re-deriving key
//! encoding, so a backfilled entry is byte-for-byte the same key an `INSERT` after the
//! index would have written — collation, `DESC`, and rowid-suffix all come out
//! identical for free, and the two paths cannot drift.
//!
//! Memory is bounded: the table is STREAMED one row at a time (never collected into a
//! `Vec`), so `CREATE INDEX` on a large table stays proportional to a single row plus
//! the index descent, not the table size.

/// transaction back, leaving neither the index b-tree, the `sqlite_schema` row, nor a
/// half-populated index behind.
///
/// For a `UNIQUE` index, a duplicate key among the existing rows is a
/// `UNIQUE constraint failed: …` error (the identical error and probe the INSERT path
/// raises — `<table>.<col>` for an ordinary index, `index '<name>'` for an expression
/// index), which aborts the create. NULL keys are exempt: a UNIQUE index
/// treats every NULL as distinct, so any number of NULL-keyed rows backfill without
/// conflict (`lang_createindex.html` §1.1).
///
/// The scan is bounded in memory: rows are streamed from the table b-tree one at a
/// time via a re-seek from the last processed rowid, so nothing table-sized is
/// materialized. (A bounded-batch scan — read K rows per descent instead of one — is a
/// possible future refinement to cut the per-row re-descent when `CREATE INDEX` at
/// scale is profiled as a bottleneck; it would not change the memory bound's shape.)
///
/// `generated` is the target table's GENERATED-column programs (bound by the planner;
/// empty for a table with none). An index over a VIRTUAL generated column must COMPUTE
/// that column to key its entries — the value is not in the stored record (`gencol.html`)
/// — so when any program is VIRTUAL each row is decoded through the virtual-aware path
/// and its virtual columns are computed before the index key is built. A STORED
/// generated column is already in the record, so a plain or STORED-only table keeps the
/// byte-identical fast decode with no per-row compute.
///
/// `index_key_exprs` is the NEW index's compiled key expressions (aligned with its
/// `columns` / `key_exprs`; `Some` = an expression key column, `None`/absent = an ordinary
/// named column). The engine binds them from the index's key expressions and passes them
/// here (see [`minisqlite_plan::QueryPlanner::index_key_programs`]); an expression index
/// (`CREATE INDEX i ON t(a+b)`) backfills by EVALUATING each key column per row. For an
/// ordinary all-named-column index the slice is empty and the backfill key is byte-identical
/// to a column-only index.
///
/// `partial_predicate` is the NEW index's compiled WHERE predicate when it is a PARTIAL index
/// (`CREATE INDEX i ON t(a) WHERE p`), `None` for a full index. The engine binds it from the
/// `CREATE INDEX` statement and passes it here; the backfill inserts an entry for a row only
/// when the predicate is TRUE over that row ([`index_key_values`] returns `None` otherwise), so
/// a partial index backfills exactly the matching rows — never phantom entries for rows outside
/// it — and a partial UNIQUE index's create errors only on a duplicate AMONG those matching rows
/// (`partialindex.html` §2, §4). A full index passes `None` and is byte-for-byte unchanged.
