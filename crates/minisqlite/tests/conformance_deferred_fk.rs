//! Conformance battery: **DEFERRED foreign-key constraint timing** — a
//! `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` constraint (and any constraint under
//! `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys`) is checked at COMMIT, not at statement time.
//!
//! Every expectation is TRANSCRIBED FROM THE SPEC (`spec/sqlite-doc/foreignkeys.html`
//! §4.2 / §4.3, `spec/sqlite-doc/pragma.html` #pragma_defer_foreign_keys), never from what
//! the engine currently returns. A case that reveals an engine bug is left as a genuine
//! failing assertion rather than weakened to pass.
//!
//! Spec anchors:
//!   * §4.2 "Deferred Foreign Key Constraints": "Deferred foreign key constraints are not
//!     checked until the transaction tries to COMMIT. For as long as the user has an open
//!     transaction, the database is allowed to exist in a state that violates any number of
//!     deferred foreign key constraints. However, COMMIT will fail as long as foreign key
//!     constraints remain in violation."
//!   * §4.2: "If the current statement is not inside an explicit transaction ... deferred
//!     constraints behave the same as immediate constraints." (AUTOCOMMIT: deferred ==
//!     immediate — the immediate check is already correct there.)
//!   * §4.2: on a COMMIT that fails because of a deferred violation, "The transaction
//!     remains open."
//!   * §4.2 deferrable spellings: only `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` is deferred; a bare
//!     `DEFERRABLE`, `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`, and `NOT DEFERRABLE` are IMMEDIATE.
//!   * §4.3: a RESTRICT action "causes SQLite to return an error immediately ... Even if the
//!     foreign key constraint it is attached to is deferred." So RESTRICT stays IMMEDIATE.
//!   * pragma.html #pragma_defer_foreign_keys: "can be used to temporarily change all foreign
//!     key constraints to deferred regardless of how they are declared"; it "is automatically
//!     switched off at each COMMIT or ROLLBACK" and "defaults to OFF".
//!
//! The exact reject error text matches real sqlite: `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`.
//!
//! Commit-point coverage (all exercised below): the deferred recheck runs at `COMMIT`, at a
//! `RELEASE` of a transaction-started SAVEPOINT (§4.2: a RELEASE that commits the transaction
//! is "subject to the same restrictions as a COMMIT"), and over BOTH rowid and WITHOUT ROWID
//! children. `SET DEFAULT` — whose post-action re-check can leave a child-side violation — is
//! deferred like NO ACTION (only RESTRICT stays immediate). `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys` is
//! "separately enabled for each transaction": it clears at COMMIT/ROLLBACK and at the START of
//! a transaction (so a stray autocommit set does not leak in), and its coverage is STICKY —
//! toggling it OFF mid-transaction still rescans a row it deferred while ON.
//!
//! REMAINING honest gaps (fail-closed or pre-existing, IDENTICAL in the immediate and deferred
//! paths, so deferred is never weaker than immediate):
//!   * An FK that references a WITHOUT ROWID PARENT is rejected with a loud "not supported"
//!     error by both the immediate check and the recheck (`parent_key_exists`, fail-closed).
//!   * `SET NULL` / `SET DEFAULT` over a generated-column CHILD is left as-is by both the
//!     immediate action and (therefore) the recheck — a pre-existing referential-action gap,
//!     not a deferral gap.
