//! Name resolution: the [`Scope`] of columns visible to an expression, built from
//! the FROM clause, plus the [`Grouping`] context that redirects references to the
//! post-aggregate row layout inside an aggregate query.
//!
//! A [`Scope`] resolves a (possibly qualified) column name to a *register* in the
//! row its expression will run against, following the shared ROW/REGISTER
//! convention (see [`crate::plan`]): a *rowid* base table with `N` columns occupies
//! `[base, base+N)` and its rowid sits at `base+N`. An `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column
//! aliases the rowid, so it resolves to `base+N` (not its own schema slot, which
//! holds NULL for a pure alias).
//!
//! A [`Source`] is either a `BaseTable` (a catalog `TableDef`) or a `Derived` (a
//! subquery in FROM / a CTE, width `columns.len()` with NO rowid — it carries its own
//! [`SynthCol`] list because it has no catalog table). A rowid `BaseTable` is width
//! `N+1` with a trailing rowid; a WITHOUT ROWID `BaseTable` is width `N` with NO rowid
//! register (it stores its rows in a PRIMARY KEY index b-tree — withoutrowid.html), so
//! `rowid`/`_rowid_`/`oid` do not resolve against it. Every resolver dispatches on the
//! variant; a `Derived` source likewise has no rowid.
