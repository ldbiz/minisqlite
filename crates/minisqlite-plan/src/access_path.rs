//! Access-path selection: [`plan_table_access`] chooses how a single base table is
//! reached — a [`RowidScan`] point-lookup / range on the integer rowid key, an
//! [`IndexScan`] seek / range over a secondary index, or a full [`SeqScan`] of last
//! resort — and returns the leftover ("residual") predicate the caller must still
//! apply as a [`Filter`].
//!
//! The choice is a small cost model over the constraints the bound WHERE places on
//! the table. Selectivity, strongest first: a rowid `=` (one row) ▷ a full-equality
//! seek of a UNIQUE index (one row) ▷ an index equality-prefix ▷ a rowid range ▷ an
//! index range ▷ the full scan. A table uses at most ONE index (no OR / index merge);
//! any constraint the chosen path does not consume stays in the residual.
//!
//! ## Correctness at the executor boundary (load-bearing)
//! The index executor ([`minisqlite_exec`]'s `index_scan`) seeks the index b-tree
//! which is ordered under [`Collation::Binary`] only, and it evaluates each seek /
//! bound expression **raw** — it applies neither operand affinity nor a NULL guard.
//! So a term is only turned into an index seek when that raw seek is provably right:
//!
//! * the comparison's resolved collation is `Binary` (else the index order can't
//!   serve it);
//! * the comparison does not force an affinity onto the COLUMN side. The index keys
//!   were written under the column's own storage affinity and ordered under Binary; a
//!   comparison that coerces the column to a *foreign* class (datatype3 §4.2 applies
//!   NUMERIC to a TEXT/NONE column facing a numeric operand, or TEXT to a NONE column
//!   facing a text one — e.g. `text_col = CAST(5 AS INTEGER)`) would need the index
//!   rebuilt under that coercion, so a raw seek would land in the wrong storage class
//!   and silently drop rows. A non-`None` column-side affinity therefore declines the
//!   index (the term falls to the residual, where the Filter applies the affinity);
//! * a **literal** value has its operand affinity applied HERE, at plan time, into a
//!   concrete non-null value, so the seek key matches exactly what the index stores
//!   — such a term is fully consumed;
//! * a **runtime** value (a bind parameter, …) is used only when no affinity coercion
//!   is required of it (otherwise the raw seek could miss rows the index stored under
//!   the coerced value); and because it might be NULL at run time, the term is ALSO
//!   kept in the residual so `col = NULL` (empty) is filtered correctly rather than
//!   matching the index's NULL entries. (A subquery is never a seek value — it is
//!   row-dependent per [`has_column_ref`], since a correlated subplan is invisible
//!   here, so it declines at the row-independence gate before this branch.)
//!
//! The rowid access path mirrors this shape (its helpers `rowid_eq_value` /
//! `rowid_bound` mirror the index matchers), but the EQUALITY path is stronger than the
//! index one: the rowid eq executor (`eval_rowid_eq`) coerces its seek value with
//! sqlite's `OP_SeekRowid` rule (`must_be_int`: NUMERIC affinity, then a lossless
//! integer, else no rows), so a rowid `=` seeks any value by that rule. A literal is
//! still folded to a concrete `Integer` HERE (and a NULL literal declines, `rowid =
//! NULL` being empty), while a runtime value (a `?` param, an expression) is emitted RAW
//! and coerced at run time — no affinity gate on the eq path. The rowid RANGE path stays
//! weaker: its executor coerces a bound with a lossy `to_integer` (NULL → 0, a fractional
//! real truncated), so a rowid *range* bound is used ONLY when it resolves here to a
//! concrete `Integer` (a runtime or non-integer bound is left to the residual).
//!
//! Consuming FEWER terms (leaving more residual) is always safe — it only adds a
//! redundant filter — so every uncertain case falls back to the residual.
