//! GENERATED-column compilation: bind a table's `AS (expr)` generation expressions
//! into executable [`GeneratedProgram`]s and hang them on the plan-level
//! [`Plan::generated`] map the read/write paths consume (`gencol.html`).
//!
//! Why a plan-level map (not a field on the scan / DML nodes): the read path computes
//! VIRTUAL columns in the SCAN LEAVES and the write path computes every generated
//! column in the INSERT/UPDATE executor, but neither the access-path leaf builder
//! (`access_path` / `compile::from`) nor the DML compilers carry the generation
//! programs — binding them there would ripple through construction sites an in-flight
//! sibling owns. Instead this pass runs ONCE after a statement is compiled, walks the
//! finished plan for the base tables it touches, binds their generation expressions,
//! and records them by table name. Every operator then reaches a table's programs
//! through the shared [`Plan`] its `Env` already holds — exactly how `subqueries` /
//! `ctes` ride on the plan.
//!
//! Binding model: each generation expression binds against a single base-table
//! [`Source`] over the table's schema at register base 0 — the SAME scope
//! [`crate::compile::check`] uses for CHECK — so a column reference resolves as it does
//! everywhere else: column `i` → `Column(i)`, and an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY alias column →
//! the trailing rowid register `N` (a generated column may reference the INTEGER PRIMARY
//! KEY column but not the bare ROWID — `gencol.html` §2.3).
//!
//! Compute order (why a topological sort, not column order): `gencol.html` §2.2 lets a
//! generated column reference ANY other generated column of the same row — including one
//! declared LATER ("Generated columns can occur anywhere in the table definition …
//! interspersed among ordinary columns") — forbidding only a dependency cycle. The
//! read/write paths compute generated values by iterating the returned program list in
//! order and writing each into its register, so that list MUST be a dependency order: a
//! program appears only after every generated column its expression reads. So this pass
//! binds in column order and then reorders the programs by [`toposort_generated`], and a
//! `d AS (e+1), e AS (5)` (d before e) evaluates `e` first and `d` second — correct
//! regardless of declaration order. A dependency cycle (which includes a direct
//! self-reference `b AS (b+1)`) is a schema real SQLite rejects at CREATE TABLE; the
//! catalog here does not re-validate it, so the sort fails closed with an error rather
//! than looping or computing a NULL-fed wrong value.
