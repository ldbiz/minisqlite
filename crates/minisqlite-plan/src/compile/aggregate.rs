//! The SELECT output layer: the projection, and — when the query aggregates — the
//! GROUP BY / HAVING / aggregate machinery beneath it.
//!
//! [`compile_result`] decides whether the query is an aggregate query (a GROUP BY,
//! a HAVING, or any aggregate call in the select list) and produces a [`Compiled`]:
//! the node that feeds the final projection, the projection expressions, the output
//! names, and (for ORDER BY resolution) the source AST of each output column. The
//! orchestrator ([`crate::compile::select`]) assembles the Project / DISTINCT /
//! ORDER BY / LIMIT around it.
//!
//! In an aggregate query the projection and HAVING bind against the post-aggregate
//! `[group_keys.., agg_results..]` layout via a [`Grouping`] context on the scope;
//! aggregate calls are collected as they are bound and become the operator's
//! [`AggregateCall`] list. When the projection carries a window function, a
//! post-aggregate windowing stage (`Aggregate → Window`) is added so the window
//! runs once per group row over that same layout — see [`compile_aggregate`].
