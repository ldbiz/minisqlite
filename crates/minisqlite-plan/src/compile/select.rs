//! The SELECT orchestrator: it wires FROM -> WHERE -> (projection / aggregate) ->
//! DISTINCT -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT into one plan tree for a single query core, and
//! compiles an expression subquery into a [`SubPlan`].
//!
//! A leading `WITH` is delegated to [`cte`](crate::compile::cte) and a compound
//! select (UNION/…) to [`compound`](crate::compile::compound), each a sibling module
//! that owns that feature. The FROM clause — including base-table joins — is compiled
//! by [`from`](crate::compile::from).
//!
//! ## Correlated subqueries (the `base_offset` / `correlated_out` seam)
//!
//! An expression subquery that references a column of an ENCLOSING query is
//! *correlated*: at runtime the executor prepends the outer row to every row the
//! subplan's leaves emit, so the subplan's own sources must be placed AFTER that
//! outer row. `outer_width = parent.outer_row_width_for_child()` is where the own
//! sources go (this is `parent.total_width()` EXCEPT under a grouping parent, where the
//! prepended row is the aggregate's POST-aggregate row — see [`compile_subplan`]), and
//! `Column(i)` for `i < outer_width` reads the outer row, `i >= outer_width` the
//! subquery's own row (see [`crate::plan`]'s ROW/REGISTER convention and
//! `minisqlite-exec`'s `open_subquery`).
//!
//! Correlation is only known AFTER binding (it depends on whether a name resolves
//! locally or via the parent), so [`compile_subquery`] uses a transactional trial:
//! it binds once at `base_offset = 0` with the parent visible and a `saw_correlated`
//! cell watching. If nothing resolved through the parent (the common, non-correlated
//! case) that single bind IS the plan; otherwise it rolls back and re-binds with the
//! own sources at `base = outer_width`. `base_offset` + `correlated_out` are threaded
//! through [`compile_body`]/[`compile_core`] (and the compound arms) so the cell is
//! set no matter where in the subquery the outer reference appears.
