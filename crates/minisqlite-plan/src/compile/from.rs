//! FROM-clause compilation, in two phases so an `ON`/`USING` predicate can bind
//! against the *whole* join's [`Scope`] (which needs every source's register offset,
//! which in turn needs the entire FROM walked first):
//!
//! * [`resolve_from`] (phase 1) walks the join tree and returns the [`Source`] list —
//!   the columns visible to the rest of the statement — with each source's `base`
//!   register offset. The caller builds the [`Scope`] from these and binds `WHERE`.
//! * [`build_from`] (phase 2) builds the access/join operator subtree: a constant
//!   `SingleRow` (no FROM), a single base table's access path, or a left-deep
//!   [`PlanNode::Join`] tree, binding each join's `ON` against that scope.
//!
//! # Scope: base tables and derived tables (subqueries in FROM)
//!
//! This handles base tables and `FROM (SELECT …) [AS] alias` derived tables, joined by
//! comma joins and every `JOIN` operator. A base table resolves to a catalog
//! [`crate::bind::Source::BaseTable`] and its rowid-aware access path; a derived table
//! resolves to a [`crate::bind::Source::Derived`] (its output schema computed in Phase
//! 1 without compiling) whose access leaf is a materialized `CtePlan` scanned by a
//! [`PlanNode::CteScan`] — width `column_count`, NO trailing rowid (the executor's
//! `ops::cte` contract). A derived *subquery* table is NON-correlated (SQLite has no
//! LATERAL for those), so its inner SELECT compiles at base 0 with no parent scope.
//!
//! # Table-valued functions (`json_each` / `json_tree`, `pragma_*`)
//!
//! A `json_each(X[,P])` / `json_tree(X[,P])` FROM function (json1.html §4.24) also
//! resolves to a [`crate::bind::Source::Derived`], but with a FIXED schema (eight visible
//! columns plus the hidden `json`/`root` input columns) ([`json_table_columns`]); its
//! access leaf is a [`PlanNode::TableFunctionScan`]
//! (not a `CtePlan`) whose argument expressions are bound in Phase 2. Unlike a subquery
//! derived table these ARE implicitly LATERAL: the argument may reference a preceding
//! table's columns, so when the function is a join's right operand the planner forces
//! [`JoinStrategy::IndexNestedLoop`] and the executor re-evaluates the argument per left
//! row.
//!
//! The `pragma_*` schema-introspection FROM functions (`pragma_table_info('t')` and the
//! rest, pragma.html §2) work the same way but carry each PRAGMA's fixed columns and lower
//! to a [`PlanNode::PragmaFunctionScan`]; their leaf/schema/argument handling lives in
//! [`crate::compile::pragma_tvf`], keeping this hot file thin. Any other function name in
//! FROM stays a loud "no such table-valued function" error.
//!
//! # Parenthesized joins (`FROM (a JOIN b …) …`)
//!
//! A parenthesized `( join-clause )` is a `table-or-subquery` that is itself a whole
//! sub-join, so a single FROM leaf can contribute MANY sources. [`resolve_leaf`] handles
//! it in both phases by recursing into the bracketed [`JoinTree`]: Phase 1 places the
//! sub-join's sources at the same flat left-to-right bases (parenthesization changes only
//! the tree SHAPE, never the register order), and Phase 2 ([`build_subjoin`]) builds it
//! as a self-contained [`PlanNode::Join`] subtree in its OWN local register space (its
//! leftmost leaf at register 0), which is exactly what the executor evaluates it in when
//! it uses the sub-join's rows, whole, as one operand of the surrounding join. That local
//! 0-based space composes with the enclosing join only when the executor runs the sub-join
//! with an EMPTY outer, which holds at `base_offset == 0` but not under a correlated /
//! trigger outer, so [`build_subjoin`] rejects a nonzero `base_offset` loudly (a precise
//! residual gap). A FLAT correlated / trigger join — the common shape — IS supported: its
//! leaves sit directly at `base_offset`, `base_offset + WL`, … and the executor prepends
//! the outer prefix exactly once (see `minisqlite-exec`'s `ops::join`).
//!
//! # Register layout (the shared ROW/REGISTER convention, see [`crate::plan`])
//!
//! A base table with `N` columns occupies `N+1` registers — `[c0, …, c_{N-1}, rowid]`.
//! In a join the sources are laid out left to right: the first at `base_offset`, each
//! subsequent one at `base_offset +` the combined width so far. A `Join` node emits
//! `left ++ right`, so its `left_width` is exactly the combined width of everything to
//! its left and its `on` predicate — bound through the scope — reads the same
//! registers the executor materializes. `base_offset` is `0` for a top-level query and
//! non-zero for a correlated subquery / trigger action, where it places the subquery's own
//! sources after the outer (`OLD ++ NEW`) row that the executor prepends at each FROM leaf.

///   convention: result names come from the left input);
/// * a `VALUES` core names columns `column1`, `column2`, … ;
/// * a query core names each result column by its explicit alias, else the bare
///   column's name, else the rendered expression text ([`result_column_name`]), and
///   expands `*` / `table.*` against the inner FROM's catalog schemas — recursively, so
///   a derived table nested in the inner FROM resolves too. Affinity/collation flow
///   through that recursion for free: a bare reference to a nested derived column reads
///   that column's already-inherited [`SynthCol`] affinity/collation, so a chain of
///   subqueries carries the base column's affinity all the way out (§3.3 applied at each
///   layer).
///
/// It is CTE-aware transitively: an inner `*` over a CTE reference expands through
/// [`resolve_table`], which consults the active CTE scope. This is also how the CTE
/// compiler ([`crate::compile::cte`]) derives a CTE's own output schema before the
/// column-name list (`WITH t(a,b) AS …`) is applied.
///
/// A WITH-bearing inner SELECT (`FROM (WITH c AS … SELECT … FROM c)`) is handled here:

// Every keyed strategy is O(left + right) or better; the nested loop is O(left * right),
// catastrophic at scale. The choice is purely physical — it preserves the result set for
// EVERY join type. A keyed strategy is correct as long as it never MISSES a pair `on`
// would keep; over-matching is harmless because the `on` the executor re-checks
// (`ops::join`'s `try_pair`/`on_keeps`) filters the surplus.
//
// What each strategy stores as the node `on` differs, because the SOUNDNESS of dropping a
// pre-filter from `on` differs:
//   * Hash stores only the RESIDUAL — the `on` with its consumed equi-keys removed. Each
//     hash key is a plain `=` with NO affinity coercion, and its collation is folded into
//     the key, so a hash-matched pair (raw key + that collation) has the `=` provably TRUE
//     and a NULL key hash-excludes. Re-checking that `=` per pair would be pure
//     O(output-pairs) waste, so it is stripped; the residual still gates every matched
//     pair. (A coerced `=`, an `IS`, or any non-equality is never a hash key, so it stays
//     in the residual — it is the real filter.)
//   * A rowid index-nested-loop stores the FULL `on`: the seek key can OVER-match (a
//     coerced rowid compare seeks the coerced value), so the full-predicate recheck is a
//     required backstop, not redundant.
//   * NestedLoop stores the FULL `on` — nothing was a usable key to strip.
// The executor's hash join fills outer (Left/Right/Full) rows itself, and a Cross/comma
// join has no `on` so it stays nested.

///
/// A rowid index-nested-loop is preferred for Inner/Left when the right side is a BASE

// A comma join `FROM a, b, c WHERE a.x = b.y AND c.z = 5` compiles to a left-deep tree
// of CROSS joins whose ONLY filter is one `Filter` above the whole join, so the executor
// forms the FULL cartesian product before filtering: O(rows ^ tables), which is billions
// of rows -- an effective hang -- once several tables join. Real SQLite treats a comma
// join with equalities in the WHERE exactly like a `JOIN ... ON` with those equalities.
// This pass does the same: it distributes each WHERE conjunct down to the LOWEST join
// node that already produces every column the conjunct reads, folding it into that node's
// `on`. A conjunct spanning two sides becomes a join predicate there (and, via
// `choose_join_strategy`, an O(n) hash key); a single-side conjunct filters at the
// earliest level so the next table multiplies against far fewer surviving rows.
//
// The output rows are unchanged: for INNER / CROSS joins the result is the cartesian
// product filtered by (all ON conjuncts AND the WHERE), and AND is associative and
// commutative under three-valued logic, so evaluating a conjunct at any node that
// provides its inputs keeps exactly the rows where it is TRUE.
//
// SAFETY GUARD: applied ONLY to a left-deep tree of INNER/CROSS joins whose right
// operands are plain leaves (the shape a comma join builds). Any outer join
// (LEFT/RIGHT/FULL) or a parenthesized sub-join right operand disqualifies the WHOLE tree
// and the entire WHERE stays as the single top `Filter` (the prior behavior): pushing a
// predicate below an outer join's null-extended side would change results, and a sub-join
// right operand lives in its own local register space this absolute-space walk must not
// touch. A conjunct containing a subquery is likewise never pushed (its correlated refs
// live in a separate subplan that `mark_sides` reports as out-of-range), so it stays in

// Join reordering for a pure comma-join FROM.
//
// `FROM a, b, c, ...` is fully commutative and associative (every join is CROSS/inner),
// so ANY leaf order yields the same result SET. The order only decides how large the
// intermediate joins grow: joining along equijoin edges (each newly added table shares a
// `WHERE t.x = u.y` with an already-joined table) keeps every step bounded, while the
// textual order can force an enormous cartesian intermediate before a connecting table
// appears -- some generated queries join up to dozens of tables in random textual order, for
// which an unreordered plan is astronomically large.
//
// The leaves are reordered greedily into a connected order BEFORE the FROM is resolved,
// so the normal resolve/bind/build pipeline then runs unchanged in the better order
// (registers, scope, WHERE, and projection all bind fresh against the new order -- no
// register remapping needed). It applies ONLY to a pure comma join of plain table leaves;
// an explicit ON join, a CROSS JOIN (SQLite's "do not reorder" barrier), a NATURAL/USING
// join, a subquery/parenthesized leaf, or any outer join is left exactly as written.
// Correctness never depends on the chosen order -- commutativity guarantees the same rows
// -- so an imperfect graph analysis can only pick a slower order, never a wrong one.

/// If `from` is a pure comma join of >= 3 plain table leaves, return a leaf-reordered
/// copy whose order joins along `where_ast` equijoin edges (greedy connected order); else
/// `None` (use the FROM as written). Reordering never changes the result set.
