//! Compound SELECT (`UNION` / `UNION ALL` / `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT`): compile the two
//! (or more) select bodies and combine them into a [`PlanNode::SetOp`](crate::plan::PlanNode::SetOp),
//! then wrap the whole compound in its outer `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT`.
//!
//! Delegation seam: [`compile_compound`] is the single entrypoint `compile_body`
//! routes a [`SelectBody::Compound`](minisqlite_sql::SelectBody::Compound) through,
//! so the set-operation feature lands here rather than in the SELECT orchestrator.
//!
//! Shape: the compound body is a left-deep tree of set operators
//! (`a UNION b UNION c` = `(a UNION b) UNION c`, left-associative per the parser).
//! `compile_setop_tree` walks it by borrowing each `&SelectBody` node — so the whole
//! chain compiles in one pass without re-cloning the growing left sub-body at every
//! level — and bottoms out at a single arm, each compiled as a standalone SELECT (no
//! ORDER BY/LIMIT of its own — those belong to the whole compound) via
//! [`compile_body`](crate::compile::select::compile_body). The two arms of each
//! operator must have equal result width; the result column *names* come from the
//! LEFT arm (the plan `SetOp` convention).
//!
//! Correlated subqueries: `base_offset` / `correlated_out` (see
//! [`crate::compile::select`]) are threaded UNCHANGED to EVERY arm, so a compound that
//! is itself a correlated subquery places each arm's own sources after the same outer
//! row and any arm referencing an outer column marks the one shared correlation cell.
