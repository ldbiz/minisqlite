//! Opportunistic `ORDER BY` -> scan-order optimization: when a single-base-table
//! `SELECT ... ORDER BY <cols> [LIMIT k]` can be served by walking the rowid or an index
//! b-tree in one direction, [`satisfy_order_by`] rewrites the access leaf and the caller
//! omits the `PlanNode::Sort` — streaming in `O(1)` sort-memory (and early-stopping under
//! a `LIMIT`) instead of materializing + sorting the whole input.
//!
//! It is PURE, OPPORTUNISTIC and FALLBACK-SAFE: it returns `Some(rewritten)` ONLY when
//! the scan order is provably BYTE-IDENTICAL to today's stable full sort, and `None`
//! (keep the Sort, exactly today's behaviour) for everything else. A missed skip is
//! fine; a wrong skip is a correctness bug, so every uncertain case keeps the Sort.
//!
//! # Correctness proof (why a skipped Sort is byte-identical to the full stable Sort)
//!
//! Today's plan is `Sort { keys }` over the access subtree, and that Sort is STABLE
//! ([`minisqlite_exec`]'s `ops::sort`): rows equal on all keys keep their INPUT order,
//! and the Sort's input is the access leaf's natural emission order (ascending rowid for
//! `SeqScan`/`RowidScan`; index-key order for an `IndexScan` `Seek`) threaded through a
//! row-order-preserving `Filter` (the WHERE residual). So the total order the current
//! plan emits is exactly: the `keys`, then the leaf's natural order for ties. We skip
//! the Sort only when the leaf, walked in a single direction, ALREADY emits that exact
//! total order.
//!
//! Load-bearing b-tree facts:
//! * **F1 (Binary).** An index b-tree is ordered under [`Collation::Binary`] only, so an
//!   index serves an `ORDER BY` term only when that term's collation is `Binary`.
//! * **F2 (NULLs first).** NULL keys sort before every value; a forward walk yields
//!   NULLs-then-ascending (= `ASC` default, `NULLS FIRST`), a reverse walk yields
//!   descending-then-NULLs (= `DESC` default, `NULLS LAST`).
//! * **F3 (rowid).** The rowid is a UNIQUE, never-NULL integer key: forward = ascending
//!   rowid, reverse = descending rowid.
//! * **F4 (reverse reverses ties).** A reverse walk steps the WHOLE key backwards
//!   (trailing index columns and the trailing rowid included), so within a group of rows
//!   equal on a PREFIX of the key it emits them in the reverse of the forward tie order.
//!
//! ## Mechanism A — rowid order (ASC and DESC)
//! The sole `ORDER BY` key is the rowid (or its `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` alias). By F3 the
//! rowid is unique, so no two rows are ever equal on the key: the total order is decided
//! by the key alone, with NO tie-break to preserve. A forward rowid walk emits ascending
//! rowid (= `ORDER BY rowid ASC`); a reverse rowid walk emits descending rowid
//! (= `ORDER BY rowid DESC`). With no ties, F4 is vacuous, so BOTH directions are
//! byte-identical to the stable sort. A WHERE rowid range is kept on the rewritten
//! `RowidScan` (its bounds are direction-agnostic) and the range still emits surviving
//! rowids monotonically.
//!
//! ## Mechanism B — index order (ASC only)
//! The `ORDER BY` keys equal, in order, a contiguous run of an index's key columns —
//! every relied-on column ASCENDING and Binary, the term collation Binary (F1), and the
//! null placement the forward scan's natural one (F2). We serve ONLY ascending (Forward):
//!
//! * **ASC / Forward.** Two sub-cases:
//!   * (i) WHERE already chose `IndexScan Seek` on index `I` (equality-prefix length `p`)
//!     and the `ORDER BY` keys are `I.columns[p .. p+k]`. The Sort's INPUT is already this
//!     index order — `(I.col_p, .., I.col_{m-1}, rowid)`, a subsequence after the Filter —
//!     and the keys are a PREFIX of it. A stable sort by a prefix of an already-sorted
//!     sequence is the IDENTITY, so dropping the Sort changes nothing — for any trailing
//!     columns, any `p`, and any WHERE range on `I.col_p`.
//!   * (ii) WHERE chose a full `SeqScan`, and some non-partial index `I` has EXACTLY the
//!     `ORDER BY` columns as its key columns (`I.columns.len() == k`). The forward index
//!     order is `(keys, rowid)` — the rowid is the only tie-break after the keys — which
//!     equals the current plan's `(keys, SeqScan input = ascending rowid)`. NULL-keyed
//!     rows are present in a full (non-partial) index and sort first, matching `ASC`
//!     default `NULLS FIRST` (F2), rowid-tie-broken on both sides. The `== k` requirement
//!     is load-bearing: an index with EXTRA trailing key columns would tie-break by those
//!     before the rowid, differing from the stable sort — so such an index is declined.
//!
//! * **DESC / Reverse — declined (keep the Sort).** A reverse index walk reverses ties
//!   (F4): within a group of rows equal on the `ORDER BY` keys it emits them in
//!   DESCENDING rowid order, whereas the stable DESC sort keeps them in the input's
//!   ASCENDING rowid order. Whenever the keys have duplicates (the ordinary case for a
//!   secondary index) these differ, so a reverse index scan is NOT byte-identical to the
//!   current plan. (Mechanism A escapes this only because its rowid key is unique.) A
//!   descending index order therefore always keeps the Sort here.
//!
//! Any condition not proven above keeps the Sort.
