//! View expansion: when a query references a `CREATE VIEW`-defined view in its FROM,
//! the view is inlined exactly like a derived table (a `FROM (SELECT …)` subquery).
//! A view owns no b-tree; its stored `CREATE VIEW … AS <select>` text
//! ([`ViewDef::sql`](minisqlite_catalog::ViewDef)) is the source of truth, re-parsed
//! and lowered here. This module is the sibling of [`crate::compile::cte`]: the FROM
//! compiler ([`crate::compile::from`]) calls into it from BOTH compilation phases so
//! the two agree on the view's schema width and its registered plan.
//!
//! * Phase 1 ([`view_schema`]) computes the view's output columns (its
//!   [`SynthCol`] list) from the parsed SELECT, honoring an explicit
//!   `CREATE VIEW v(c1,c2,…)` column-name list — the same schema an inline derived
//!   table gets, so the outer scope binds `Column(base+i)` against it.
//! * Phase 2 ([`compile_view`]) compiles the SELECT into a fresh
//!   [`CtePlan::Materialized`] and returns the [`PlanNode::CteScan`] leaf that reads
//!   it — identical lowering to `compile_derived`, so the executor needs no view-aware
//!   code (a view is a materialized CTE by the time it reaches it).
//!
//! # Recursion / circular guard (the [`ViewGuard`] view stack)
//!
//! A view body may reference other views (or, by mistake, itself, directly or
//! transitively). Expansion recurses through
//! `resolve_table → derived_schema → resolve_table` (Phase 1) and
//! `compile_view → compile_select → … → build_source_leaf → compile_view` (Phase 2),
//! so an unguarded self-reference would recurse forever. A thread-local stack of the
//! view names currently being expanded ([`VIEW_STACK`]) makes re-entry of a name
//! already in progress a loud `view X is circularly defined` error rather than a hang
//! (`build.c`'s message). A depth cap ([`MAX_VIEW_DEPTH`]) is a second, belt-and-suspenders
//! bound. The guard is held across the recursive schema/compile call and pops on drop
//! (including an early `?`), so the stack stays balanced. Like the CTE scope, planning
//! is single-threaded per statement, so the thread-local is a per-statement ambient
//! value, never shared across concurrent planners.
//!
//! # Why a view body cannot see the referencing query's CTEs
//!
//! A view is a self-contained schema object. When it is expanded inside a query that
//! has its own `WITH` clause, that query's CTEs are still on the shared CTE scope
//! stack; the view's body must NOT resolve one of them (only its own `WITH` and base
//! tables/views). Both phases hold a [`crate::compile::cte::IsolatedCteScope`] to empty
//! that stack for the duration of the view's schema computation / compilation, matching
//! how real SQLite compiles a view against a fresh context.
